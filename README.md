# Full-Stack-MERN-Exercise-Tracker-App
 OSU CS290 WebDev Final Project

## This app uses MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React & Node to generate a full stack MERN App that functions as an exercise tracker. The app has Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete features.

### Download the files as separate client (stonejeff_react) and server (stonjeff_rest) directories and run `npm install` for each from separate terminals. The client runs on localhost:8000 and the server runs on localhost:3000.
